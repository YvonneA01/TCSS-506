```Script Details
The script checks if sshfs is installed and installs it if necessary.

It creates a mount point directory (/mnt/aws) if it doesn't already exist.

It mounts mount the home directory on my aws instance to this mount point if it is not mounted using sshfs.

The script uses SSH key-based authentication (assuming SSH keys are properly configured) to authenticate without requiring password input.

Notes
Ensure that SSH access is allowed and SSH key-based authentication is properly configured on the remote server.

Adjust the mount point directory (MOUNT_POINT) and sshfs options (-o allow_other) as needed based on the need case.```
